# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into reusable and structured units known as objects. It is widely used to improve code organization, maintainability, and scalability in software development.

## Key Concepts in OOP:

1. **Classes:** Fundamental units in OOP that encapsulate data and behavior.
  
2. **Constructor:** A special method within a class used for initializing object properties when an instance is created.

3. **Destructor:** A method that is called when an object is no longer needed, responsible for releasing resources.

4. **Access Modifiers:** Keywords like public, private, and protected that define the scope of class members.

5. **Inheritance:** A mechanism allowing a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.

6. **Constants:** Immutable values that do not change during the execution of a program.

7. **Abstract Classes:** Classes that cannot be instantiated and often serve as blueprints for other classes.

8. **Interfaces:** Contracts that define a set of methods a class must implement.

9. **Traits:** Reusable code snippets that can be composed into classes.

10. **Static Methods/Properties:** Methods/properties associated with a class rather than an instance.

11. **Namespaces:** Containers that allow organizing code and avoiding naming conflicts.

12. **$this and self:** References to the current object instance and the class itself.
